# EVs_Analysis :electric_plug::battery::blue_car:
- EV_Analysis.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that contain the analysis for most popular electric vehicles currently or soon will be available in the market. <br />
- The data that I used was being scaped on ev-database.org and accessible on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/cheapest-electric-cars/code" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The data was a year old so that a lot of datapoint is not accurate especially price of the car. However, given that I rank all the features base on the other car on the list will still give a fairly accurate result. <br />
- My goal is to point out some interesting features as well as answer some questions. For example, What is the fastest car? What is the cheapest car? What is the most valueable car? What is the best car in all catergory? <br />
- There are 4 part of the analysis: <br />
## 1. Import and Load: :link:
- Contain all the used package as well as the setting for the jupyter notebook. Data will be upload using files.upload() method
## 2. Data Cleaning: :broom:
- The given data has many unneccessary words and units, so that we need to clean them out for better calculation
## 3. Data Analysis: :wrench::computer:
- Adding Data feature like Brand and Average_Price in USD for better visibility and data correlation.
- Answer all the question above by ranking data on each catergory.
## 4. Data Virtualization: :signal_strength:
- Showing how each features relate to each other using Pairplot, Heatmap and Scatter Plot
